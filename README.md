# example_native_html_form

This example uses Vanilla Javascript without any framework or javascript library.

I wrote a small custom validator for inputs.

The head also contains `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` 
to make the page responsive, this is with respect to media queries : `@media(max-width:800px)`
